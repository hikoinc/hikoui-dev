# Contributing to Hikoui

> We’re actively developing Hikoui and preparing to welcome contributions soon.

Thanks so much for your interest in contributing!  
Right now, we’re focused on building and stabilizing the core codebase, tooling, and workflows.

We’re not accepting external contributions _just yet_, but we’re excited to open things up in the near future.  
When ready, we’ll update this guide with clear instructions on how you can get involved.
